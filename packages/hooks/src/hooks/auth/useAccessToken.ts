/**
 * Pick a logged-in character whose token can authorise an ESI request.
 *
 * `characterId`, `corporationId` and `allianceId` narrow *which* character is
 * eligible: corporation- and alliance-scoped ESI routes are still authenticated
 * with a character token, so the caller has to end up with a character that
 * actually belongs to the corporation/alliance being queried. Every character
 * that clears the filters is equally able to authorise the request, so the
 * first one wins.
 *
 * `roles` is enforced the same way as `scopes`: a character is only eligible if
 * `corporationRoles` — read from ESI by useAuthStore — actually contains every
 * required role. Roles that have never been read are an empty list, so such a
 * character is excluded rather than tried on spec. That means a caller passing
 * `roles` must ALSO make the corporation-roles scope a requirement of the page
 * (its ScopeGuard), otherwise a user who never granted it gets no token here
 * and no way to find out why.
